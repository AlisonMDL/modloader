Primary:
[ ] Track loader (.ogg)
[ ] Loading CLEO scripts without copy-paste (using std-asi IAT hooking to accomplish that)
[ ] Support for more data files (std-data)

Secondary:
[ ] Porting to other executables
[ ] MPACK loader

Tertiary:
[ ] Integration with the game menu
[ ] Installing and uninstalling stuff by game menu
[ ] Loading files directly from zipped files


The primary objectives need to be done at all cost, since it's needed to support all game files.
The secondary objectives will be done but aren't primary
The tertiary objectives would be good

All tertiary objectives need the rewrite of the modloader.asi core with them in mind.
