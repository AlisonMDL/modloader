For compatibility purposes (i.e. no Microsoft compiler which supports C++14) we are using C++11 features only.
We do need some C++14 features (specially return type deduction and generic lambdas) to make the code readable,
currently some parts of the code are horrible to read due to the lack of C++14.

Wait for it, and update it.

Most places in the source code with such problem are marked with the CXX14 tag (just grep for it)
