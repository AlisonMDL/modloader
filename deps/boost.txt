Only Boost.Variant and Boost.Optional is required for us
Notice boost/ doesn't contain the entire boost library but boost::variant, boost::optional and its dependencies.
The boost version on here is 1.57.0

Additional Notice:
  boost/optional/detail/optional.hpp has been modified, added a macro in between the forwardly declared operator<< so it
  doesn't conflict with user defined one (from datalib)
