[Config]
IgnoreAllFiles = false            ; Ignores all files. This essentially disables mods loading
ExcludeAllMods = false            ; Excludes all mods from being loaded except the ones at INCLUDE_MODS list

; --------------------------> Exclusion/Inclusion <------------------------------

[Priority]
;
; Define mods priority here
; The priority must be from 1 to 100, where 100 has the highest and 1 has the lowest priority
; The priority 0 will make the mod not to load but it's prefered to use the [IgnoreMods] section
; By default each mod has the priority of 50, and mods received by command line will have a priority of 80
; Just put the mod folder name followed by '=' and it's priority (e.g. MyMod=50)
;
; PS¹: Files following a simple overriding rule, so for example, if a mod A has priority 100 and mod B has priority 1 and both has a LOADSCS.txd
;      the LOADSCS.txd from mod B will be used, because LOADSCS.txd from A was loaded then B was loaded, overriding the LOADSCS from A
;

[IgnoreMods]
; Put mods to be ignored here (this is not a glob)
_ignore

[IgnoreFiles]
; Put files globs to be ignored here (e.g. cheetah.dff, *.dff)

[IncludeMods]
; Put mods to be included in the game even when ExcludeAllMods=true or you passed a -mod command line to the game
