[Priority]
;
; Define plugins priority here
; The priority must be from 1 to 100, where 100 has the highest and 1 has the lowest priority
; The priority 0 means "DO NOT LOAD". Standard plugins normally have priorities in the range 45-55
; Just put the path to the plugin module here, without extension and replacing slashes with a dot.
; Example:
;    gta3.std.text=0
;    to disable gta3/std.text.dll
;
