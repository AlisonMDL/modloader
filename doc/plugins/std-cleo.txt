	Name: std-cleo --- (Standard CLEO Plugin)
	Version: RC1
	Author: LINK/2012 <dma_2012@hotmail.com>
	Default Priority: 50

Description:
	This is the standard CLEO loader, it loads files related to the CLEO modification.
	So, it handles the following extensions: cs, cm, cleo and fxt.

Usage:
	Just copy the specific CLEO file with cs, cm, cleo or fxt extension to anywhere inside a mod folder.
	Or you can put the files inside a CLEO folder inside a mod folder.
	The second way is recommended and is normally what comes in packed mods.

Weakness and Limitations:
	[*] It goes against one of the ModLoader main rules, to not touch the main game install.
	    This plugin copies CLEO specific files into the CLEO\ folder at the main path.
	   	But yeah, it does a cleanup when the game closes. On abnormal game termination, the cleanup is done on game startup.
	   	
	   	For that reason, I'd recommend the use of CLEO mods at the CLEO\ folder in the main game path.
	   	But the choice is yours.
	   	
	[*] Can't load .cleo plugins, the reason?
	    Because when the .cleo plugin file is finally copied into the CLEO\ folder, CLEO.asi has already take care of the .cleo plugins.
