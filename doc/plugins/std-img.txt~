	Name: std-img --- (Standard IMG Loader Plugin)

Description:
	The standard IMG loader is the standard plugin for loading IMG files data in modloader.
	It can load all formats a normal IMG can, that is: dff, txd, col, ipl, dat, ifp, rrr, scm.
	It can also handle a img folder, that is, everything inside an "gta3.img" folder will be handled as img files.

Usage:
	First way:  Just place your files (see list of supported formats) in the mod folder.
	Second way: Optionally you can create a folder with the extension img (example: "gta3.img") and place your files inside it.
	
	By using the first way, other plugins can handle the file too, providing extensibility.
	By using the second way, only this plugin will handle the files inside the folder.
	The first way is recommended.


Weakness and Limitations:
	[*] Limited to 4GB of dff/txd/col/etc mods
	[*] Needs double the size of the mods beucase it will create a copy of the files in another .img
		so, for example, if you have 50MB of cars (dff/txd), you need more 50MB for the temporary img,
		that's a total of 100MB.
	[*] May crash if you have another img at "data/gta.dat" because the loader uses more imgs and the game has a limit of imgs.
		To solve this, install this ASI mod: http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=19468

TODO:
	[*] Try (I don't even think this will work better, but just try) to load files directly from disk.
	[*] Fix 4GB limit (checkout img92.cpp)
	[*] player.img compatibility
	[*] Test formats img files can handle (dff, txd, col, ipl, dat, ifp, rrr, scm)
